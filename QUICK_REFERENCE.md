# SecureRouteX - Quick Reference & Session Prompt
# ===============================================

## ðŸš€ INSTANT CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSIONS

**Copy-paste this when reopening:**

"I'm working on SecureRouteX, a GAN-based trust-aware AI-SDN routing system for heterogeneous IoT networks (Healthcare, Transportation, Underwater). We've completed 98% including: (1) Full GAN implementation with 1000+ lines of code, (2) Enhanced dataset with 9,000 samples across 3 domains, (3) Multi-dimensional trust calculation methodology, (4) Complete 10/10 publication-quality graphs with literature backing, (5) All documentation and validation complete. Review meeting tomorrow (28 Sept 2025). Status: Ready for presentation. See PROJECT_STATE_CONTEXT.md for full details."
